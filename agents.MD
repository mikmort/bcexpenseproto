Best practices for AL
05/16/2025
This page defines some of the best practices to follow when writing AL code for Dynamics 365 Business Central. These best practices are additive to rules and guidelines that are caught during compilation of AL code. We recommend following these best practices when developing extensions in AL to ensure consistency and discoverability on file, object, and method naming, as well as better readability of written code.

 Tip

Check out the great work that is going on at https://alguidelines.dev/. New design patterns and best practices are being established, so join the discussions, and contribute through GitHub.

Extension structure
An extension is fully contained in a single folder. This folder often contains multiple files, such as app.json and launch.json files, perhaps an image file representing the extension's logo, various folders for source; \src, other resources; \res, and a test folder; \test folder. The extension doesn't need to follow a flat structure, which means that, depending on the number of application files, extra folders can be used in the "src" or "test" folders to group objects based on their functionality, which can help make maintaining a large AL project easier.

File naming
Each file name should contain the object name (using only characters A–Z, a–z, and 0–9), the object type, and the .al file extension. In your extension, the name of each new application object (table, page, codeunit), can contain a prefix or suffix.

The CodeCop analyzer suggests that the object name is part of the file name, which is encouraged as a best practice. Adding any affixes to the file names is voluntary.

 Note

If you're submitting an app to AppSource, you must follow the guidance in the Technical validation checklist.

File naming notation
Follow the syntax for file naming as shown in the table:


Expand table
Full objects	Extensions
<ObjectNameSuffix>.<FullTypeName>.al	<ObjectNameSuffix>.<FullTypeName>Ext.al
<PrefixObjectName>.<FullTypeName>.al	<PrefixObjectName>.<FullTypeName>Ext.al
<ObjectNameExcludingAffix>.<FullTypeName>.al	<ObjectNameExcludingAffix>.<FullTypeName>Ext.al
Type map
Use the listed abbreviations for each type of object in the file naming:


Expand table
Object	Abbreviation
Page	Page
Page Extension	PageExt
Page Customization	PageCust
Codeunit	Codeunit
Table	Table
Table Extension	TableExt
XML Port	Xmlport
Report	Report
Request Page	RequestPage
Query	Query
Enum	Enum
Enum Extension	EnumExt
Control Add-ins	ControlAddin
Dotnet	Dotnet
Profile	Profile
Interface	Interface
Permission Set	PermissionSet
Permission Set Extension	PermissionSetExt
File naming examples
For the listed objects in the table, these examples show how to name the files.


Expand table
Object name	File name
codeunit 70000000 MyPrefixSalesperson	MyPrefixSalesperson.Codeunit.al
page 70000000 MyPrefixSalesperson	MyPrefixSalesperson.Page.al
pageextension 70000000 MyPrefixSalesperson extends "Customer Card"	MyPrefixSalesperson.PageExt.al
Examples of object naming
Table
AL

Copy
table 70000000 MyPrefixSalesperson
Page
AL

Copy
page 70000000 MyPrefixSalesperson
Action
AL

Copy
actions
{
    addafter(ApprovalEntries)
    {
        action(MyPrefixVacation)
Codeunit
AL

Copy
codeunit 70000000 MyPrefixSalesperson
Copilot and action names
Trailing whitespaces are allowed in action names, meaning that you don't get a compiler error. For example these names are accepted:

AL

Copy
group("CopilotActionGroup  ")
{
    action("Suggest Sales Lines   ")
    {
        // Code that generates sales lines suggestions
    }
}
However, these trailing whitespaces are trimmed internally and aren't recognized by Copilot. To ensure that Copilot works correctly with your feature, you must avoid trailing spaces in action names. Instead, write the code like this:

AL

Copy
group("CopilotActionGroup")
{
    action("Suggest Sales Lines")
    {
        // Code that generates sales lines suggestions
    }
}
Formatting
We recommend keeping your AL code properly formatted as follows:

Use all lowercase letters for reserved language keywords. Built-in methods and types aren't included in this rule because they're written using Pascal case.
Use four spaces for indentation.
Curly brackets should always start on a new line. If there's only one property, it can be placed on a single line.
The following example illustrates these formatting rules.

AL

Copy
page 123 PageName
{
    actions
    {
        area(Processing)
        {
            action(ActionName)
            {
                trigger OnAction()
                begin
                end;
            }
        }
    }

    var
        TempCustomer: Record Customer temporary;

    [EventSubscriber(ObjectType::Page, Page::"Item Card", 'OnAfterGetCurrRecordEvent', '', false, false)]
    local procedure OnOpenItemCard(var rec: Record Item)
    var
        OnRecord: Option " ", Item, Contact;
    begin
        EnablePictureAnalyzerNotification(rec."No.", OnRecord::Item);
    end;
}

The AL Language extension for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central offers users the option to automatically format their source code. Learn more in AL Formatter.

Line length
In general, there's no restriction on line length, but lengthy lines can make the code unreadable. We recommend that you keep your code easily scannable and readable.

Object naming
Object names should be prefixed, starting with the feature or group name, followed by the logical name, as illustrated in the following examples:

Intrastat extension validation codeunit for Denmark
codeunit 123 "IntrastatDK Validation"
 Note

The "MS - " prefix isn't required.

File structure
Inside an .al code file, the structure for all objects must follow the sequence:

Properties
Object-specific constructs such as
Table fields
Page layout
Actions
Triggers
Global variables
Labels
Global variables
Methods
Referencing
In AL, objects are referenced by their object name, not by their ID.

Example
AL

Copy
Page.RunModal(Page::"Customer Card", ...)
 
var
    Customer: Record Customer;
Variable and field naming
For variables they must:

Be named using PascalCase
Have the Temp prefix if they're temporary variables
Include the object name in the name (for objects)
Furthermore:

Field and variable names shouldn't include wildcard symbols, such as % and &. This might break features such as export using Excel or RapidStart.
Name fields using A–Z, a–z, and 0–9 and use Caption and xliff files to display the field appropriately. For more information, see Working with translation files.
Using English as the language for naming improves the ability to troubleshoot issues that may arise.
Example
AL

Copy
TempCustomer: Record Customer temporary;
Vendor: Record Vendor; 
Method declaration
To declare a method, follow these guidelines:

Include a space after a semicolon when declaring multiple arguments.
Semicolons can be used at the end of the signature/method header. If you use a snippet, the semicolons aren't automatically added.
Methods should be named using PascalCase, like variables. However, this isn't a mandatory rule.
There must be a blank line between method declarations. If you format your code using the AL Formatter tool, the autoformatter sets the blank line between procedures.
Example
AL

Copy
local procedure MyProcedure(Customer: Record Customer; Int: Integer)
begin
end;

// Blank line between methods

local procedure MyProcedure2(Customer: Record Customer; Int: Integer)
begin
end;

Calling methods
When calling a method, include one space after each command if you're passing multiple parameters. Parentheses must be specified when you're making a method call or system call such as: Init(), Modify(), Insert(), etc.

Example
AL

Copy
MyProcedure();
MyProcedure(1);
MyProcedure(1, 2); 
Type definition (colon)
When you declare a variable or a parameter, the name of that variable or parameter must be immediately followed by a colon, then a single space, and then the type of the variable/parameter as illustrated in the example.

AL

Copy
var
    Number: Integer;

local procedure MyProcedure(a: Integer; b: Integer): Integer
