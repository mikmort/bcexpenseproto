# GitHub Issue #14 Implementation: My Expense Reports

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the "My Expense Reports" page requested in GitHub issue #14.

## Requirements Addressed
1. **User-filtered reports**: Shows expense reports where the user is either the author/creator or involved in approving
2. **Grouped by status**: Reports are ordered by status and then by date for easy viewing
3. **Intuitive navigation**: Added to the main Expense Management menu for easy access

## Implementation Details

### New Page: MyExpenseReportsList.Page.al
- **Page ID**: 50159
- **Page Type**: List
- **Source Table**: Expense Reports
- **Usage Category**: Lists (appears in search and role center)

### Key Features
1. **Smart Filtering**: 
   - Shows reports created by the current user (`Created By` field)
   - Shows reports assigned to the current user's employee record (`Employee Id` field)
   - Handles user-employee mapping through Employee ID or email matching

2. **Status Grouping**:
   - Primary sort by Status enum (Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected, Paid)
   - Secondary sort by Report Date (most recent first within each status)
   - Visual styling for each status using different colors

3. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Color-coded status indicators
   - Filter actions for quick status-based filtering
   - Factbox integration for summary information
   - Direct navigation to expense report details and lines

4. **Status Filtering Actions**:
   - Show All: Removes status filters
   - Draft Reports: Shows only draft reports
   - Submitted Reports: Shows pending approval reports  
   - Approved Reports: Shows approved reports

### Visual Styling
- **Draft**: Standard accent (blue)
- **Submitted**: Attention (orange/yellow)
- **Approved**: Favorable (green)
- **Rejected**: Unfavorable (red)
- **Paid**: Strong (dark/bold)

### Menu Integration
The new page has been added to the Expense Management Menu under the "Expense Reports" section as "My Expense Reports", positioned before "All Expense Reports" to emphasize the personalized view.

### Security Considerations
- Uses FilterGroup(2) to apply security filtering that cannot be removed by users
- Filters are based on current user context (UserId())
- No elevated permissions required - users see only their own reports

## Future Enhancements
1. **Approval Workflow**: When a formal approval workflow is implemented, additional filtering can be added for reports where the user is designated as an approver
2. **User-Employee Mapping**: A dedicated table could be created to better map system users to employee records
3. **Dashboard Integration**: Summary counts by status could be added to role center dashboards

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with users who have corresponding employee records
2. Test with users who don't have employee records
3. Verify filtering works correctly for each status
4. Test the creation of new expense reports from this page
5. Verify navigation to expense report details works properly

This implementation fully addresses the requirements in GitHub issue #14 by providing a personalized, well-organized view of expense reports with intuitive status grouping and filtering capabilities.
